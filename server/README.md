# Pompot Server

This module hosts the Spring Boot backend that powers Pompot. It serves the compiled client bundle over HTTP when launched in UI mode and prints a CLI about message when started with `--mode=cli`.

The module consumes the static assets generated by the client build under `src/main/resources/static` and exposes them at `http://localhost:9754/`.
